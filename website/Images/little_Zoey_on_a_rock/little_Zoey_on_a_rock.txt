An elven princess sitting upon the highest cliff side overlooking her kingdom, gazing out over her beloved homeland for what may be the last time in years. The once, vibrant forests and crystal rivers below seem quieter now, shadows creeping where sunlight once danced. Forced to flee after her kingdom was seized by a ruthless and corrupt force, she carries only her courage, her heritage, and the faint hope of return. Banished from the lands she swore to protect, she must embark on a journey across distant realms. Seeking allies, forging unlikely bonds, and gathering the strength to challenge the darkness that claimed her home. Each step will test her resolve, but with every friend she gains and every battle she wins, she moves closer to the day she will reclaim her throne and restore the light to her kingdom.
